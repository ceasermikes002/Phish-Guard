# PHISH GUARD: An Interactive Anti-Phishing Game

## **DESCRIPTION:**

PHISH GUARD is an engaging and interactive web-based anti-phishing game designed to educate users about the deceptive tactics employed in phishing attempts. In today's digital landscape, where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, understanding how to identify and avoid phishing scams is crucial for everyone. This game simulates real-world email scenarios, allowing users to learn through practical experience, honing their ability to recognize and protect themselves from online fraud.

PHISH GUARD isn't just about recognizing phishing; it's about building user awareness and fostering a proactive approach to online security. We believe that empowering individuals with the knowledge to identify phishing attempts is the most effective way to keep them safe from cyber threats. By putting players into realistic email scenarios, they not only become informed, but also develop the intuition to spot and avoid scams.

    *   **Flask:** If you have Python installed, you can install Flask using pip, the Python package manager, by running this command in your terminal:
        ```bash
        pip install Flask
        ```

    This command launches the Flask web server, which will host the game.

2.  **Access the Game:** After executing the command, you will receive a local host link in your terminal, which will be something like this: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`. Click on this link to open the game in your web browser.

3.  **Start Playing:** You'll be presented with a series of email scenarios. Carefully analyze each email and determine if it's a legitimate message or a phishing attempt. Click the appropriate button to indicate your choice and continue your session.

## **FEATURES:**

PHISH GUARD is packed with exciting features to make learning about phishing both informative and fun:

*   **INTERACTIVE PHISHING SCENARIOS:**
    *   Players are immersed in realistic email scenarios that closely mirror real-world phishing attempts. These scenarios range from simple and obvious attempts to more complex and subtle ones that are harder to identify. You'll be challenged to think critically and apply your knowledge to determine the authenticity of each email.

*   **REAL-TIME FEEDBACK:**
    *   After each decision, you'll receive immediate feedback. If you correctly identify a phishing email, the game will confirm your decision, and if you selected a legitimate email, the game will also notify you and highlight the elements that made it so. When you select the wrong choice, a clear and detailed explanation will be provided, illustrating why the email is a phishing attempt or a legitimate message, helping you understand the subtle signs and tricks that scammers use. This will enhance your understanding of what to look out for.

*   **PERFORMANCE REPORT:**
    *   At the end of each game session, you'll receive a comprehensive performance report. This report includes statistics on how many phishing attempts you correctly identified, the number of mistakes you made, and an overall score to evaluate your performance, thereby helping you track your progress and see how your anti-phishing skills are evolving.

*   **EDUCATIONAL INSIGHTS:**
    *   Each phishing scenario is accompanied by an educational tip. These tips will help you understand the tactics that phishers use and how to avoid them. They will include important reminders about the key elements of legitimate emails, highlighting the importance of always verifying the sender and their requests. These educational insights empower you to protect yourself in the real world.
